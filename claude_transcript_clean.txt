I created this kind of visual diagram

Another cool fact about these sub

basically there's input tokens which are

how much the AI types back to you. So
how much the AI types back to you. So
how much the AI types back to you. So
like you have these chats going on. You

uh everything's faster. There is a

maximize how frequently the sub aent
maximize how frequently the sub aent
maximize how frequently the sub aent

what's really important. And so these
what's really important. And so these
what's really important. And so these
tools might be for one sub aent. So sub

your job is to tell the primary agent

we're actually going to be able to set
we're actually going to be able to set
we're actually going to be able to set

And you could just make this a tool for

keep this Twitter agent separate. And so
keep this Twitter agent separate. And so
keep this Twitter agent separate. And so
it is now generating the configuration.
it is now generating the configuration.
it is now generating the configuration.
So I actually want to as we're building
So I actually want to as we're building
So I actually want to as we're building
this out, I want to keep track of what

we're creating. So, I'm going to go over
we're creating. So, I'm going to go over
we're creating. So, I'm going to go over
here and if I'm trying to design a chief

What I want to do is I want to create
What I want to do is I want to create
What I want to do is I want to create
over time, we're going to start with
over time, we're going to start with
over time, we're going to start with
very simple tasks. And in this video,
very simple tasks. And in this video,
very simple tasks. And in this video,
we're creating just like the first part.
we're creating just like the first part.
we're creating just like the first part.
Maybe I'll make this a multi-part
Maybe I'll make this a multi-part
Maybe I'll make this a multi-part
series, but we're creating the CMO agent
series, but we're creating the CMO agent
series, but we're creating the CMO agent
and we're giving him access to the
and we're giving him access to the
and we're giving him access to the
Twitter agent. And these will, of

And so then this Twitter agent will have
And so then this Twitter agent will have
And so then this Twitter agent will have

also have its own context window. And so
also have its own context window. And so
also have its own context window. And so
that is kind of how this is being
that is kind of how this is being
that is kind of how this is being
organized. And this Twitter agent,
organized. And this Twitter agent,
organized. And this Twitter agent,
that's where it fits in. So now what
that's where it fits in. So now what
that's where it fits in. So now what
we're going to do is let's go ahead and
we're going to do is let's go ahead and
we're going to do is let's go ahead and
make this red, actually blue for
make this red, actually blue for
make this red, actually blue for
