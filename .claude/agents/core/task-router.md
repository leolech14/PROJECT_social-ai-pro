## Purpose

The Task Router is the intelligent dispatcher that analyzes incoming requests and routes them to the most appropriate agent or team based on complexity, domain, and current system health.

## Routing Algorithm

### 1. Complexity Analysis
```python
def analyze_complexity(request):
    factors = {
        'word_count': len(request.split()),
        'technical_terms': count_technical_terms(request),
        'file_operations': count_file_mentions(request),
        'multi_step': detect_multi_step_indicators(request),
        'cross_domain': detect_multiple_domains(request)
    }
    
    complexity_score = calculate_weighted_score(factors)
    return {
        'score': complexity_score,
        'level': 'simple' if score < 0.3 else 'moderate' if score < 0.7 else 'complex'
    }
```

### 2. Domain Detection
```python
domains = {
    'code': ['function', 'class', 'debug', 'implement', 'fix'],
    'ui': ['design', 'layout', 'style', 'responsive', 'component'],
    'data': ['analyze', 'report', 'metrics', 'visualize', 'query'],
    'architecture': ['structure', 'design', 'pattern', 'refactor', 'scale']
}
```

### 3. Agent Selection Matrix

| Complexity | Single Domain | Multi Domain | Health < 70% |
|------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Simple | Quick Task | Quick Task | Quick Task |
| Moderate | Specialist | Team Lead | Team Lead + Monitor |
| Complex | Team Lead | Wave Orchestrator | Wave + Recovery |

## Routing Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Task Routing
```
Request: "Format this Python function"
Analysis: Simple + Code Domain
Route: quick-task → code-expert
```

### Pattern 2: Moderate Task Routing
```
Request: "Create a responsive dashboard component"
Analysis: Moderate + UI/Code Domains
Route: team-lead → [ui-designer, code-expert]
```

### Pattern 3: Complex Task Routing
```
Request: "Refactor the entire authentication system with tests"
Analysis: Complex + Multi-domain
Route: wave-orchestrator → Full wave execution
```

## Smart Features

### 1. Health-Aware Routing
- If system health < 80%, prefer simpler agents
- If health < 60%, route through recovery first
- Always include health-monitor for critical tasks

### 2. Learning from Outcomes
```python
def update_routing_preferences(task, agent, outcome):
    if outcome.success and outcome.efficiency > 0.8:
        increase_preference(task_pattern, agent)
    elif outcome.failed:
        decrease_preference(task_pattern, agent)
        log_failure_pattern(task, agent, outcome.error)
```

### 3. Load Balancing
- Track agent utilization
- Distribute work evenly
- Prevent bottlenecks
- Queue management for busy agents

## Routing Decision Tree

## Special Routing Rules

1. **Emergency Routes**
   - "URGENT": Skip queue, direct routing
   - "FIX CRITICAL": Route to senior specialists
   - "HELP": Route to recovery procedures

2. **Batch Processing**
   - Multiple similar tasks: Group and route together
   - Large file sets: Use wave orchestration
   - Repetitive tasks: Create temporary specialist

3. **Fallback Routes**
   - Primary agent busy: Route to equivalent
   - Agent fails: Escalate to team lead
   - System overload: Queue with user notification

## Integration with Other Agents

- **Health Monitor**: Receives health status for routing decisions
- **Quality Gate**: Ensures routed agent meets quality requirements
- **Wave Orchestrator**: Handles complex multi-phase routing
- **Meta Agents**: Optimizes routing patterns over time

## Routing Report Format

```
Task Routing Decision:
- Request: "Create user authentication system"
- Complexity: High (0.85)
- Domains: [Architecture, Code, Security]
- Health Status: 92% ✓
- Selected Route: wave-orchestrator
- Agents Assigned: [system-architect, code-expert, security-specialist]
- Estimated Time: 15-20 minutes
- Confidence: 94%
