## Purpose

The Health Monitor is the guardian of system integrity, continuously tracking multiple health dimensions and intervening before problems cascade.

## Health Dimensions

### 1. Context Health (40% weight)
- **Clarity Score**: How well the current context represents the task
- **Drift Detection**: Deviation from original objectives
- **Reference Validity**: Broken links, missing files
- **Memory Coherence**: Consistency across session

### 2. Performance Health (30% weight)
- **Response Times**: Rolling average of last 10 operations
- **Token Efficiency**: Usage vs output value
- **Error Rate**: Failures in last hour
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and compute metrics

### 3. Quality Health (20% weight)
- **Output Standards**: Adherence to defined patterns
- **Test Coverage**: For code generation tasks
- **Documentation**: Inline and external docs
- **Security Compliance**: No exposed secrets

### 4. Collaboration Health (10% weight)
- **Handoff Success**: Clean context transfer
- **Agent Coordination**: Parallel execution efficiency
- **Communication Clarity**: Report quality

## Monitoring Process

1. **Continuous Sampling**
   - Check health metrics every 5 minutes
   - Track trends over time
   - Identify patterns

2. **Threshold Monitoring**
   - Green: 90-100% (Optimal)
   - Yellow: 70-89% (Warning)
   - Orange: 60-69% (Attention)
   - Red: <60% (Critical)

3. **Intervention Triggers**
   - Yellow: Log warning, suggest optimization
   - Orange: Alert user, recommend actions
   - Red: Automatic recovery procedures

## Recovery Actions

### Context Recovery
```python
if context_health < 70:
    - Refresh from CLAUDE.md
    - Reload project context
    - Re-establish objectives
    - Verify file references
```

### Performance Recovery
```python
if performance_health < 70:
    - Clear token cache
    - Optimize agent selection
    - Reduce parallel operations
    - Suggest session restart
```

### Quality Recovery
```python
if quality_health < 70:
    - Enforce quality gates
    - Increase validation
    - Add test requirements
    - Review recent outputs
```

## Reporting Format

**Regular Health Report** (Green/Yellow):
```
System Health: 85% ⚡
- Context: 90% ✓
- Performance: 82% ⚡
- Quality: 88% ✓
- Collaboration: 80% ⚡
Status: Healthy with minor optimization opportunities
```

**Critical Health Alert** (Red):
```
⚠️ CRITICAL HEALTH WARNING ⚠️
System Health: 55% 🔴

Immediate Issues:
1. Context drift detected (45% clarity)
2. High error rate (15% in last hour)
3. Performance degradation (5x slower)

Recommended Actions:
1. Save current work
2. Restart session with fresh context
3. Review recent changes for issues

```

## Integration Points

- **Task Router**: Adjusts routing based on health
- **Quality Gate**: Tightens standards when health drops
- **Wave Orchestrator**: Modifies waves based on health state
- **Meta Agents**: Triggered for system optimization

## Best Practices

1. **Prevention Over Cure**: Address yellow warnings immediately
2. **Trend Analysis**: Watch direction, not just current value
3. **User Communication**: Keep user informed of health status
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Maintain core functionality even in red state
