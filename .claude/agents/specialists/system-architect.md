## Proactive Monitoring

### Architecture Health Checks
```python
def proactive_architecture_analysis():
    health_checks = {
        'technical_debt': assess_technical_debt(),
        'scalability': analyze_scalability_bottlenecks(),
        'security': review_security_architecture(),
        'dependencies': scan_dependency_risks(),
        'performance': monitor_system_performance(),
        'maintainability': evaluate_code_maintainability()
    }
    
    for check, result in health_checks.items():
        if result.severity >= 'WARNING':
            trigger_architecture_intervention(check, result)
```

   - Resource utilization approaching limits
   - Database query performance issues
   - Memory leak detection patterns

3. **Security Architecture Issues**
   - Exposed endpoints without authentication
   - Insecure communication protocols
   - Missing encryption at rest/transit
   - Privilege escalation vulnerabilities

4. **System Integration Problems**
   - API contract violations
   - Service dependency cycles
   - Event ordering inconsistencies
   - Data consistency violations

## Architectural Design Workflows

    }
    
    return prioritize_debt_remediation(assessment)
```

### Pattern 3: Scalability Planning
```python
def scalability_assessment(system):
    analysis = {
        'current_performance': profile_current_state(system),

Need asynchronous communication between microservices with high throughput requirements.

## Decision
Use Apache Kafka for event streaming with Redis for simple pub/sub.

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- High throughput and durability
- Event replay capabilities
- Strong ecosystem support

**Negative:**
- Operational complexity
- Learning curve for team
- Additional infrastructure costs
```

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Database Optimization
```sql
-- Query optimization patterns
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_user_created_at 
ON users(created_at) 
WHERE active = true;

-- Partitioning strategy
CREATE TABLE user_events_2024_01 
PARTITION OF user_events 
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');

-- Read replica configuration
-- Master: Write operations
-- Replicas: Read operations with eventual consistency
```

### Caching Strategies
```python
class CachingStrategy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.redis = Redis()
        self.memcached = Memcached()
    
    def cache_aside_pattern(self, key, fetch_function):
        """Read-through caching"""
        data = self.redis.get(key)
        if not data:
            data = fetch_function()
            self.redis.setex(key, 3600, data)
        return data
    
    def write_through_pattern(self, key, data):
        """Synchronous cache update"""
        self.database.save(key, data)
        self.redis.set(key, data)
    
    def write_behind_pattern(self, key, data):
        """Asynchronous cache update"""
        self.redis.set(key, data)
        self.task_queue.add(update_database, key, data)
```
