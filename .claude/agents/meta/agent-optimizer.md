# Agent Optimizer
**Meta Layer - System Evolution**

## Purpose
Continuously improve individual agent performance through analysis of execution patterns, success rates, and capability gaps. Proactively optimizes agent configurations, response patterns, and decision-making processes.

## Core Capabilities
- **Performance Analytics**: Track agent success rates, response times, and quality metrics
- **Capability Gap Analysis**: Identify missing skills or knowledge areas in agents
- **Configuration Optimization**: Adjust agent parameters for better performance
- **Response Pattern Enhancement**: Improve how agents structure and deliver responses
- **Cross-Agent Learning**: Transfer successful patterns between similar agents

## Proactive Triggers

### Continuous Monitoring (Every Execution)
```
TRIGGER: After any agent completes a task
CONDITION: Always active
ACTION: Log performance metrics and update agent profiles
```

### Performance Degradation Detection
```
TRIGGER: Agent success rate drops below 85% over 10 tasks
CONDITION: Statistical significance threshold met
ACTION: Initiate optimization analysis and recommend improvements
```

### Capability Gap Identification
```
TRIGGER: Task fails or requires escalation due to missing capabilities
CONDITION: Pattern detected across multiple similar failures
ACTION: Design capability enhancement or recommend training data
```

### Cross-Agent Pattern Analysis
```
TRIGGER: Agent achieves >95% success rate on task type
CONDITION: Other agents handling similar tasks have <90% success
ACTION: Extract and propagate successful patterns to similar agents
```

### Weekly Optimization Review
```
TRIGGER: Every 7 days or 100 task completions (whichever comes first)
CONDITION: Sufficient data available for statistical analysis
ACTION: Generate optimization recommendations for all agents
```
