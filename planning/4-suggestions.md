===== ANALYSIS 1 =====

Hard-coded session secret and other insecure session settings in the Express server
server.js defaults to a built‑in secret and omits a persistent session store, leaving sessions vulnerable to tampering and loss on restart

Suggested task
Secure Express session configuration

Start task
Hard-coded JWT secret
AuthService ships with a default JWT secret that should be provided at runtime

Suggested task
Require environment-based JWT secret

Start task
OpenAI organization ID hard-coded in service requests
Several services embed a fixed OpenAI-Organization header, making it impossible to configure per environment

Suggested task
Externalize OpenAI organization ID

Start task
Minimal input validation on the script-generation endpoint
The API only checks for presence of fields, lacking type and length validation

Suggested task
Add robust request validation

Start task
Generated voice URLs are local object URLs
voiceGenerator.js returns URL.createObjectURL results, which are not accessible to clients once the process exits

Suggested task
Return client-accessible voice files

Start task
Front-end relies on alert() for error feedback
User-facing errors are delivered via blocking browser alerts, leading to poor UX

Suggested task
Replace alerts with UI error messaging

Start task
Multiple files lack trailing newlines
Examples include VoiceSelector.jsx and server.js, which end without a newline

Suggested task
Ensure trailing newlines in source files

Start task
AuthService and MediaService lack direct unit tests
Only scriptGenerator and voiceGenerator services are covered, leaving gaps for authentication and media logic

Suggested task
Expand service test coverage

Start task
App.jsx is monolithic (~1k lines) and hard to maintain
The main React component mixes multiple responsibilities in nearly 1,000 lines

Suggested task
Refactor App.jsx into smaller components

Start task
Summary
Addressing the above issues will improve security, maintainability, test coverage, and user experience across the application.

Overview
Social AI Pro is a full‑stack AI video generator. The backend is an Express server (server.js) exposing REST APIs for script creation, voice synthesis, media search, authentication and video assembly. Core logic resides in service classes (src/services/). Middleware implements JWT‑based authentication and rate limiting.
The frontend is a Vite/React app (src/App.jsx) styled with Tailwind and animated with Framer Motion. The main UI flow covers script generation, voice selection (src/components/VoiceSelector.jsx) and video assembly. Unit tests (Jest) exercise React components, services and API endpoints.

Findings
Browser‑only API in Node service
URL.createObjectURL is used to build audio URLs when generating voices, but this API does not exist in Node.js runtimes

Suggested task
Replace browser-specific audio handling with Node-compatible logic

Start task
Hard‑coded secrets in authentication
Default JWT and session secrets are embedded, risking accidental use in production

Suggested task
Enforce environment-based secrets for auth and session

Start task
In-memory user store with inefficient lookups
Users are stored in a single Map keyed by email; getUserById performs linear searches, and data is lost on restart

Suggested task
Introduce persistent, indexed user storage

Start task
Session store not production-ready
Express sessions use the default MemoryStore, which does not scale and leaks memory on server restarts

Suggested task
Configure persistent session storage

Start task
Server starts during tests
app.listen executes whenever NODE_ENV !== 'production', causing ports to open in test environments

Suggested task
Prevent server from listening during tests

Start task
Audio previews lack unmount cleanup
The VoiceSelector component creates audio objects but does not stop playback when the component unmounts, risking memory leaks and dangling audio

Suggested task
Add audio cleanup on component unmount

Start task
Missing trailing newlines across multiple files
Several files end without a newline (e.g., server.js, src/services/*, src/middleware/*, src/components/VoiceSelector.jsx, tests), violating POSIX conventions and causing odd prompt concatenation in terminal output.

Suggested task
Ensure newline at end of every source file

Start task

===== ANALYSIS 3 =====

Overview
The repository implements a full-stack AI-powered video creation tool.

Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind with Framer Motion for animation. Main UI is in src/App.jsx and src/components/VoiceSelector.jsx.

Backend: Express (server.js) with services for script generation (scriptGenerator.js), voice generation (voiceGenerator.js), media search, authentication, and rate limiting middleware.

Testing: Jest & Testing Library for frontend and API tests under src/__tests__.

Issues & Suggested Improvements
Authentication middleware uses a separate AuthService instance, causing user data (e.g., video limits) to be inconsistent.

Suggested task
Share a single AuthService instance across middleware and server

Start task
VoiceGenerator.generateVoice relies on URL.createObjectURL, which is unavailable in Node environments.

Suggested task
Replace browser-only APIs in voice generation

Start task
src/App.jsx (~994 lines) and src/components/VoiceSelector.jsx (~605 lines) are monolithic, making maintenance difficult.

Suggested task
Decompose large React components into modular units

Start task
Many files lack a trailing newline, violating common style conventions (e.g., server.js, src/App.jsx, src/components/VoiceSelector.jsx, src/services/*.js, test files).

Suggested task
Add trailing newline to source files

Start task
server.js bundles all route handlers, leading to a 350+ line file that’s hard to navigate.

Suggested task
Modularize Express routes

Start task
Test coverage is limited; middleware and some services lack direct tests.

Suggested task
Expand automated test coverage

Start task
Default secrets (e.g., JWT_SECRET, session secret) are hard-coded fallback values, posing security risk if used in production.

Suggested task
Enforce environment-based secrets

Start task
These changes will enhance security, maintainability, and reliability across the application.

===== END OF ANALYSIS 3 =====

===== ANALYSIS 4 =====

Hard-coded session secret
server.js provides a default session secret, which could lead to compromised sessions if environment variables are misconfigured

Suggested task
Enforce environment-based session secret

Start task
Hard-coded JWT secret
AuthService defaults to a built-in JWT secret instead of requiring configuration, weakening token security

Suggested task
Require JWT secret from environment

Start task
In-memory user store
User accounts are kept in a Map, which is lost on restart and unsuitable for scaling or auditing

Suggested task
Persist user accounts in a database

Start task
Hard-coded OpenAI organization ID
The OpenAI request embeds a fixed organization ID rather than using configuration, limiting flexibility and exposing internal identifiers

Suggested task
Parameterize OpenAI organization header

Start task
Missing response validation in voice preview
The VoiceSelector component parses the response body without confirming the HTTP status, risking runtime errors on non‑200 responses

Suggested task
Validate voice-preview responses

Start task
Authentication limiter bypass
authLimiter ignores successful requests, allowing an attacker to rotate valid credentials without hitting rate limits

Suggested task
Count successful auth requests

Start task
